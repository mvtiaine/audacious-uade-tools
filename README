This repo contains Scala CLI scripts for generating songdb TSV files used by audacious-uade (https://github.com/mvtiaine/audacious-uade).

* Directories:

- songdb/ - Scala CLI, SQL scripts and raw source TSVs to generate the final processed TSV files
- tsv/encoded/ - the songdb TSV files used by audacious-uade. The files are "encoded" to almost binary format to optimize for size and fast in-memory songdb initialization.
- tsv/pretty/ - pretty printed / clear text versions of the TSV files. See "spec" below.
- misc/ - misc bash scripts

* Hashing

There are two alternative hashing methods provided and separate TSVs for each under md5 and xxh32 subfolders.
- MD5 - 48-bits (MSB) as hex, hash calculated from whole file
- XXH32+filesize - 48-bits as hex (32-bit + 16-bit). Calculated+concatenated as hex(XXH32(file)) + hex(filesize & 0xFFFF). XXH32 is calculated from max first 256k bytes only, filesize is full filesize.

* Songdb TSV files:
- tsv/pretty/*/songlengths.tsv - subsong and songlengths info
- tsv/pretty/*/modinfos.tsv - module file format and channel info
- tsv/pretty/*/metadata.tsv - AMP/Demozoo/Modland/Mods Anthology/ExoticA (old)/UnExoticA/Wanted Team metadata merged to single TSV

- tsv/pretty/*/amp.tsv - author/album metadata sourced from AMP
- tsv/pretty/*/demozoo.tsv - author/publisher/album/year metadata sourced from Demozoo
- tsv/pretty/*/modland.tsv - author/album metadata sourced from Modland
- tsv/pretty/*/modsanthology.tsv - author/publisher/album/year metadata sourced from Mods Anthology
- tsv/pretty/*/oldexotica.tsv - author/publisher/album/year metadata sourced from ExoticA (old)
- tsv/pretty/*/unexotica.tsv - author/publisher/album/year metadata sourced from UnExoticA
- tsv/pretty/*/wantedteam.tsv - author/publisher/album/year metadata sourced from Wanted Team

* Raw TSV source files:

- songdb/sources/aminet.tsv - module infos and songlengths for Aminet
- songdb/sources/amp.tsv - module infos and songlengths for AMP
- songdb/sources/demozoo.tsv - Demozoo metadata generated with SQL query (songdb/scripts/sql/demozoo.sql) from Demozoo postgres database dump
- songdb/sources/demozoo_leftovers.tsv - module infos and songlengths for Demozoo downloads (excluding AMP/Modland downloads). Link list is generated with songdb/scripts/sql/demozoo_leftovers.sql
- songdb/sources/modland.tsv - module infos and songlengths for Modland
- songdb/sources/modland_incoming.tsv - modules infos and songlengths for Modland incoming directory
- songdb/sources/modsanthology.tsv - module infos and songlengths for Mods Anthology
- songdb/sources/oldexotica.tsv - module infos and songlengths for ExoticA (old)
- songdb/sources/unexotica.tsv - module infos and songlengths for UnExoticA
- songdb/sources/wantedteam.tsv - module infos and songlengths for Wanted Team
- songdb/sources/zakalwe.tsv - module infos and songlengths for Zakalwe chip git repo

Except for demozoo.tsv, the raw TSV source files are generated using the precalc binary+script https://github.com/mvtiaine/audacious-uade/blob/master/src/plugin/cli/precalc/ from my local copy/mirror/snapshot of the various sites/sources.

Note that some additional required files not included in Github, specifically local mirror of some of the AMP, ExoticA (old), UnExoticA and Wanted Team web pages + Mods Anthology txt files are needed to actually run the Scala songdb.sc script.
Note also that only files playable by audacious-uade are included in the database.
The script runs completely locally and does not download anything from internet.

Here are example snippets and short spec for the pretty printed TSVs. Example parsing code can be found in songdb/scripts/pretty.sc

The TSV files use UTF-8 encoding.

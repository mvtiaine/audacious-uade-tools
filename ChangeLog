- Implemented duplicate subsong detection using audio fingerprints
- Improved metadata accuracy and coverage for audio fingerprint matching

2025-07-23
- Audio fingerprinting (chromaprint) support:
-- metadata is now also matched/combined based on audio fingerprints, to support different rips, corrupted files etc.
-- may cause false positive matches, but tried to find acceptable balance between correctness and coverage
-- source tsv files with fingeprints available in songdb/sources/audio/ (see scripts/sources/audio.sc for format)

2025-07-18
- XXH32 hashing support:
-- faster hash alternative to MD5, also using only first 256k bytes for hash.
-- actual hash is hex(xxh32) + hex(filesize & 0xffff)) (= 48 bits/12 chars of hex)
- TSV directory structure changed, with separate md5 and xxh32 subdirs for encoded and pretty tsv files.
- combined.tsv renamed to metadata.tsv
